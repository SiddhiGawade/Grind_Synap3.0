# Fix CORS Issue on Render - URGENT

## Current Situation
Your Render backend is deployed but CORS is failing. I've added debugging code to help identify the exact issue.

## IMMEDIATE STEPS

### Step 1: Redeploy Backend with Debugging
1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your backend service: "grind-synap3-0-1"
3. Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables
1. In your Render service, go to "Environment" tab
2. Verify `FRONTEND_BASE` is set to: `https://grind-synap3-0-kappa.vercel.app`
   - **NO trailing slash!**
   - If it has a trailing slash, remove it and save
3. If you make changes, redeploy again

### Step 3: Check Debug Logs
1. After redeployment, go to "Logs" tab in Render
2. Visit your frontend: https://grind-synap3-0-kappa.vercel.app
3. Look for debug output in logs like:
```
üîç CORS Debug:
  Incoming origin: "https://grind-synap3-0-kappa.vercel.app"
  FRONTEND_BASE env var: "https://grind-synap3-0-kappa.vercel.app"
  Parsed FRONTEND_BASES: ["https://grind-synap3-0-kappa.vercel.app"]
```

### Step 4: Temporary Fix
I've added a temporary rule that allows ALL .vercel.app domains. This should work immediately after redeployment.

## What You Should See
- ‚úÖ No more CORS errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ Debug logs showing origin comparison
- ‚úÖ API calls working from frontend

## If Still Failing
Send me the debug logs from Render, specifically the lines starting with "üîç CORS Debug:"
